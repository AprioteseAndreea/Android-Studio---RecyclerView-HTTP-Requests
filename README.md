# Android-Studio---RecyclerView-HTTP-Requests
- Create in a Fragment a RecyclerView. 
- Using a Http Method, obtain all the users from following path: “https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users”. Load users into your RecyclerView. 
- Each RecyclerView cell for a user must have an arrow button pointing down. When click on the arrow, obtain posts for that specific user from “https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts”(url is incomplete because it displays posts for all users) and show them under the user (do not duplicate posts - load them only if they were not loaded before). 
- When click on a cell representative for a user (but not on the arrow), open a new fragment that contains another RecyclerView.
- Get all albums for that specific user from here “https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums” (url is incomplete because it displays albums for all users) and show them in your list.
- When click on a cell representative for an album, open a new fragment that contains another RecyclerView as a Grid.
- Load inside this 3rd RecyclerView all photos for that specific album from here: “https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos” (url is incomplete because it displays photos for all albums)
